# Love_Calculator

A basic Love Calculator made using JavaScript.

Making this calculator as part of my course was what taught me conditionals (if else statements) which I went on to use to code my (slightly more advanced, but still not amazing) Magic 8-Ball.
I was only required to make the code give a percentage for the love score as an alert, but I improved the code I was taught by console logging the names, then instead of just giving the results as a percentage I added in my own little messages which are determined by which random number is generated. Chunks of numbers were assigned specific answers dpeending on how high/low the percentage is. For example, if you score between 0 and 20% you get the message, "Wow, you're basically Johnny Depp and Amber Heard at this point. See you in court!"

Eventually, when I learn how to integrate JavaScript with HTML and CSS (soon!) I will make this as a site on it's own for people to test and play around with.


--- How this works ---

User is prompted to enter two names

Using Math.random and Math.floor the code generates a random "love score" percentage between 1% and 100%

After generating a random number, the code then spits out an alert giving a love score percentage with a short message depending on the love score generated
